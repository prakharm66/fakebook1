Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.\

Before running this , make sure you have npm installed on your machine

## Some details

This app has 3 parts -  Sign up , Sign in , Dashboard .\
The js and Css files for Sign up and Sign are in src/Signup .\
The js and Css files for Dashboard are in src/Dashboard .\
Main code for the dashboard is written in src/App.js 

I tried to deploy it on github by following a tutorial on geek for geeks , that repo- [https://github.com/prakharm66/fakebook] but when I opened the link it showed a blank page ,So i have provided my React App code in this repo

Suggestions are welcome , Thank You
